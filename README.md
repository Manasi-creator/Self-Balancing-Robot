# Self-Balancing-Robot
This project is a two-wheeled self-balancing robot. It uses an MPU6050 IMU for tilt sensing and an Arduino-based PID controller to dynamically adjust motor speeds. The custom motor control ensures stability, making it a robust platform for demonstrating sensor fusion and real-time control systems.
